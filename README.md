# Doggie Photo Gallery

This project was cute and a lot of fun to build. This was a nice way to learn routing, templating and REST API endpoints. 
It is exactly as the title states - a dog photo gallery. With this app the user can:
* select a dog breed from a drop down menu
* select number of pics to view from a drop down menu 
* press random button and the app will randomly select a dog photo
